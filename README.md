About Tenta
===========

This bitstream library is brought to you by Team Tenta. Tenta is your [private, encrypted browser](https://tenta.com) that protects your data instead of selling. We're building a next-generation browser that combines all the privacy tools you need, including built-in OpenVPN. Everything is encrypted by default. That means your bookmarks, saved tabs, web history, web traffic, downloaded files, IP address and DNS. A truly incognito browser that's fast and easy.
